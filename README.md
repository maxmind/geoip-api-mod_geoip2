GeoIP Legacy Apache module
==========================

Important Note
--------------

This API is for the GeoIP Legacy format (dat). To read the MaxMind DB format
(mmdb) used by GeoIP2, please see
[mod_maxminddb](https://github.com/maxmind/mod_maxminddb).

Description
-----------

The mod_geoip2 module embeds GeoIP Legacy database lookups into the Apache web
server. It is only capable of looking up the IP of a client that connects to
the web server, as opposed to looking up arbitrary addresses.

This module works with Apache 2. Please use
[mod_geoip](http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/mod_geoip/mod_geoip-latest.tar.gz)
with Apache 1.

Version
-------

The latest version of mod_geoip2 is version 1.2.9.

Installation
------------

You can [download
mod_geoip2](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-mod_geoip2/releases)
from GitHub or get the latest development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-mod_geoip2). See the
`INSTALL` file in the tarball for installation details.

Overview
--------

The mod_geoip2 module uses the libGeoIP library to look up geolocation
information for a client as part of the http request process. This module is
free software, and is licensed under the [Apache
license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

To compile and install this module, you must first install [libGeoIP
1.4.8](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/downloadable/#MaxMind-Supported_APIs)
or newer.

The mod_geoip2 module takes effect either during request header parsing phase
or the post read request phase, depending on whether it is configured for
server-wide use or for a specific location/directory.

When enabled, the module looks at the incoming IP address and sets some
variables which provide geolocation information for that IP. The variables it
set depend on the specific GeoIP Legacy database being used (Country, City,
ISP, etc.). These variables can be set in either the request notes table, the
environment or both depending on the server configuration.

Configuration
-------------

GeoIP configuration directives must be placed in the main Apache server config
(i.e. not in .htaccess files).  After installing the module, make sure that

    GeoIPEnable On

is set in your Apache configuration file. This will call the GeoIP Legacy
Country database from its default location (e.g.
/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat)

If you want to specify options, for example to use a different database or to
pass caching options, you can use the `GeoIPDBFile` directive:

### File and Caching Directives

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat [GeoIPFlag]

For example:

    GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
    GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPOrg.dat Standard

The default GeoIPFlag value is Standard, which does not perform any caching,
but uses the least memory. To turn on memory caching use:

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache

The memory cache option can use a large amount of memory. We recommend that
you use Memory Caching only for the smaller database files, such as GeoIP
Legacy Country and GeoIP Legacy ISP.

Another MemoryCache option is MMapCache, which uses the the `mmap`
system call to map the database file into memory.

If you would like the API to check to see if your local GeoIP Legacy files
have been updated, set the `CheckCache` flag:

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat CheckCache

Before making a call to the database, geoip will check the GeoIP.dat file to
see if it has changed. If it has, then it will reload the file. With this
option, you do not have to restart Apache when you update your GeoIP Legacy
databases.

If you would like to turn on partial memory caching, use the
`IndexCache` flag:

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat IndexCache

The IndexCache option caches the most frequently accessed index portion of the
database, resulting in faster lookups than StandardCache, but less memory
usage than MemoryCache. This is especially useful for larger databases such as
GeoIP Legacy Organization and GeoIP Legacy City. For the GeoIP Legacy Country,
Region and Netspeed databases, setting the IndexCache option just causes the C
API to use the MemoryCache.

Currently, multiple GeoIPFlags options can not be combined.

### Enabling UTF-8 Output

You may change the output character set from ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) to UTF-8
with this directive:

    GeoIPEnableUTF8 On

By default mod_geoip2 sets variables in both the notes table and environment.
For performance reasons you may want to set only the one you use. To do so,
use the `GeoIPOutput` configuration directive:

### Output Variable Location

    GeoIPOutput Notes   # Sets the Apache notes table only
    GeoIPOutput Env     # Sets environment variables only
    GeoIPOutput Request # Sets input headers with the geo location information
    GeoIPOutput All     # Sets all three (default behaviour)

### Proxy-Related Directives

By default, this module will simply look at the IP address of the client.
However, if the client is using a proxy, this will be the address of the
proxy. You can use the `GeoIPScanProxyHeaders` directive to look at proxy-
related headers.

    GeoIPScanProxyHeaders On

When this is set, the module will look at several other sources for the IP
address, in this order:

-   The `HTTP_CLIENT_IP` environment variable (set by Apache).
-   The `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` environment variable (set by Apache).
-   The `X-Forwarded-For` for header (set by a proxy).
-   The `HTTP_REMOTE_ADDR` environment variable (set by Apache).

This module will use the first IP address it finds in one of these locations
*instead* of the IP address the client connected from.

Some of these variables may contain a comma-separate list of IP addresses
(when a client goes through multiple proxies). In this case, the default
behavior is to use the first IP address. You can set the
`GeoIPUseLastXForwardedForIP` directive to use the last address instead:

    GeoIPUseLastXForwardedForIP On

Or use `GeoIPUseFirstNonPrivateXForwardedForIP` to use the first non
private IP Address.

    GeoIPUseFirstNonPrivateXForwardedForIP On

Apache 2.4 users using mod_remoteip to pick the IP address of the user should
disable GeoIPScanProxyHeaders. Mod_geoip2 will use whatever mod_remoteip
provides.

    GeoIPScanProxyHeaderField FieldName

Sometimes it is useful to use another field as the source for the client's IP
address. You can set this directive to tell this module which header to look
at in order to determine the client's IP addres.

table, the environment, or both. The specific variables which are set depend

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of how you can use mod_geoip2.

### Redirecting a client based on country

This example show you how to redirect a client based on the country code
that GeoIP sets.

    GeoIPEnable On
    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat

    # Redirect one country
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{ENV:GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE} ^CA$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.canada.com$1 [R,L]

    # Redirect multiple countries to a single page
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{ENV:GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE} ^(CA|US|MX)$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.northamerica.com$1 [R,L]

### Blocking a client based on country

This example show you how to block clients based on the country code that
GeoIP Legacy sets.

    GeoIPEnable On
    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat

    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE CN BlockCountry
    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE RU BlockCountry
    # ... place more countries here

    Deny from env=BlockCountry

### Allowing clients based on country

This example show you how to allow only clients from specific countries.

    GeoIPEnable On
    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat

    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE US AllowCountry
    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE CA AllowCountry
    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE MX AllowCountry
    # ... place more countries here

    Deny from all
    Allow from env=AllowCountry

### Server vs Directory context

All directives except GeoIPEnable are server config only, i.e., you type it
only once per server config. Otherwise the latest wins.

    <IfModule mod_geoip.c>
      GeoIPEnable Off
      GeoIPEnableUTF8 On
      GeoIPOutput Env
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPCity.dat MemoryCache
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPOrg.dat MemoryCache
    </IfModule>

GeoIPEnable is useful in server or directory context. For example:

GeoIP is only available for a specific location:

    <IfModule mod_geoip.c>
      GeoIPEnable Off
      GeoIPEnableUTF8 On
      GeoIPOutput Env
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
    </IfModule>

    # GeoIP information is avail only inside /xxx
    <Location /geoip-enabled>
      GeoIPEnable On
      ...
    </Location>

    <Location /other>
      ...
    </Location>

GeoIP is available for all locations:

    <IfModule mod_geoip.c>
      GeoIPEnable On
      GeoIPEnableUTF8 On
      GeoIPOutput Env
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
    </IfModule>

    # This doesn't work, because it's already been enabled in the server-wide
    # config!
    <Location /geoip-enabled>
      GeoIPEnable On
    </Location>

    <Location /geoip-disabled>
      GeoIPEnable Off
    </Location>

Memory Usage
------------

Starting with mod_geoip2 version 1.2.1, all Apache child processes share the
same database when you set the MemoryCache or MMapCache flag.

Memory usage is about the same as the database file size, no matter how many
child processes Apache spawns. The only thing to remember is ask Apache to
update if your database changes. Use the graceful restart option to do so
without stopping Apache.

Performance
-----------

For improved performance, you may want to enable mod_geoip only for specific
HTML pages. If you want to use the mod_geoip module site-wide, you may still
be able to only use it for HTML pages and not images. To restrict the pages
where mod_geoip2 is used, place the `GeoIPEnable On` directive inside a , or
directive, see:
[httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/sections.html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/sections.html)

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the module is not working, make sure that the httpd user (e.g. nobody) has
read access to the GeoIP Legacy database file(s) you are using.

If the GeoIP Legacy variables do not show up please make sure that the client
IP address is not on a private network such as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 or
192.168.0.0/16. GeoIP Legacy can only look up public IP addresses.
