mod_geoip2 1.2.8
----------------

The mod_geoip2 module embeds GeoIP database lookups into the Apache web
server. It is only capable of looking up the IP of a client that
connects to the web server, as opposed to looking up arbitrary
addresses.

Version
-------

The latest version of mod_geoip2 is version 1.2.8.

Installation
------------

You can [download
mod_geoip2](http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/mod_geoip2/) from
our download server. See the `INSTALL` file in the tarball for
installation details.

Overview
--------

The mod_geoip2 module uses the libGeoIP library to look up geolocation
information for a client as part of the http request process. This
module is free software, and is licensed under the [Apache
license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

To compile and install this module, you must first install [libGeoIP
1.4.3](http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/) or newer.

The mod_geoip2 module takes effect either during request header parsing
phase or the post read request phase, depending on whether it is
configured for server-wide use or for a specific location/directory.

When enabled, the module looks at the incoming IP address and sets some
variables which provide geolocation information for that IP. The
variables it set depend on the specific GeoIP database being used
(Country, City, ISP, etc.). These variables can be set in either the
request notes table, the environment or both depending on the server
configuration.

Configuration
-------------

GeoIP configuration directives can be placed in either an `.htaccess`
file or in the main server config. After installing the module, make
sure that

    GeoIPEnable On

is set in your Apache configuration file. This will call the GeoIP
Country database from its default location (e.g.
/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat)

If you want to specify options, for example to use a different database
or to pass caching options, you can use the `GeoIPDBFile` directive:

### File and Caching Directives

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat [GeoIPFlag]

For example:

    GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
    GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPOrg.dat Standard

The default GeoIPFlag value is Standard, which does not perform any
caching, but uses the least memory. To turn on memory caching use:

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache

The memory cache option can use a large amount of memory. We recommend
that you use Memory Caching only for the smaller database files, such as
GeoIP Country and GeoIP ISP.

Another MemoryCache option is MMapCache, which uses the the `mmap`
system call to map the database file into memory.

If you would like the API to check to see if your local GeoIP files have
been updated, set the `CheckCache` flag:

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat CheckCache

Before making a call to the database, geoip will check the GeoIP.dat
file to see if it has changed. If it has, then it will reload the
file. With this option, you do not have to restart Apache when you
update your GeoIP databases.

If you would like to turn on partial memory caching, use the
`IndexCache` flag:

    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat IndexCache

The IndexCache option caches the most frequently accessed index portion
of the database, resulting in faster lookups than StandardCache, but
less memory usage than MemoryCache. This is especially useful for larger
databases such as GeoIP Organization and GeoIP City. For the GeoIP
Country, Region and Netspeed databases, setting the IndexCache option
just causes the C API to use the MemoryCache.

Currently, multiple GeoIPFlags options can not be combined.

### Enabling UTF-8 Output

You may change the output charset from ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) to UTF-8 with
this directive:

    GeoIPEnableUTF8 On

By default mod_geoip2 sets variables in both the notes table and
environment. For performance reasons you may want to set only the one
you use. To do so, use the `GeoIPOutput` configuration directive:

### Output Variable Location

    GeoIPOutput Notes   # Sets the Apache notes table only
    GeoIPOutput Env     # Sets environment variables only
    GeoIPOutput All     # Sets both (default behaviour)

### Proxy-Related Directives

By default, this module will simply look at the IP address of the
client. However, if the client is using a proxy, this will be the
address of the proxy. You can use the `GeoIPScanProxyHeaders` directive
to look at proxy-related headers.

    GeoIPScanProxyHeaders On

When this is set, the module will look at several other sources for the
IP address, in this order:

-   The `HTTP_CLIENT_IP` environment variable (set by Apache).
-   The `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` environment variable (set by Apache).
-   The `X-Forwarded-For` for header (set by a proxy).
-   The `HTTP_REMOTE_ADDR` environment variable (set by Apache).

This module will use the first IP address it finds in one of these
locations *instead* of the IP address the client connected from.

Some of these variables may contain a comma-separate list of IP
addresses (when a client goes through multiple proxies). In this case,
the default behavior is to use the first IP address. You can set the
`GeoIPUseLastXForwardedForIP` directive to use the last address instead:

    GeoIPUseLastXForwardedForIP On

Or use `GeoIPUseFirstNonPrivateXForwardedForIP` to use the first
non private IP Address.

    GeoIPUseFirstNonPrivateXForwardedForIP On


Output Variables
----------------

As noted above, these variables can be set in either the Apache request
notes table, the environment, or both. The specific variables which are
set depend on the database you are using.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of how you can use mod_geoip2.

### Redirecting a client based on country

This example show you how to redirect a client based on the country code
that GeoIP sets.

    GeoIPEnable On
    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat

    # Redirect one country
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{ENV:GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE} ^CA$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.canada.com$1 [R,L]

    # Redirect multiple countries to a single page
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{ENV:GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE} ^(CA|US|MX)$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.northamerica.com$1 [R,L]

### Blocking a client based on country

This example show you how to block clients based on the country code
that GeoIP sets.

    GeoIPEnable On
    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat

    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE CN BlockCountry
    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE RU BlockCountry
    # ... place more countries here

    Deny from env=BlockCountry

### Allowing clients based on country

This example show you how to allow only clients from specific countries.

    GeoIPEnable On
    GeoIPDBFile /path/to/GeoIP.dat

    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE US AllowCountry
    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE CA AllowCountry
    SetEnvIf GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE MX AllowCountry
    # ... place more countries here

    Deny from all
    Allow from env=AllowCountry

### Server vs Directory context

All directives except GeoIPEnable are server config only, i.e., you type
it only once per server config. Otherwise the latest wins.

    <IfModule mod_geoip.c>
      GeoIPEnable Off
      GeoIPEnableUTF8 On
      GeoIPOutput Env
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPCity.dat MemoryCache
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPOrg.dat MemoryCache
    </IfModule>

GeoIPEnable is useful in server or directory context. For example:

GeoIP is only available for a specific location:

    <IfModule mod_geoip.c>
      GeoIPEnable Off
      GeoIPEnableUTF8 On
      GeoIPOutput Env
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
    </IfModule>

    # GeoIP information is avail only inside /xxx
    <Location /geoip-enabled>
      GeoIPEnable On
      ...
    </Location>

    <Location /other>
      ...
    </Location>

GeoIP is available for all locations:

    <IfModule mod_geoip.c>
      GeoIPEnable On
      GeoIPEnableUTF8 On
      GeoIPOutput Env
      GeoIPDBFile /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat MemoryCache
    </IfModule>

    # This doesn't work, because it's already been enabled in the server-wide
    # config!
    <Location /geoip-enabled>
      GeoIPEnable On
    </Location>

    <Location /geoip-disabled>
      GeoIPEnable Off
    </Location>

Memory Usage
------------

Starting at mod_geoip2 version 1.2.1, all Apache child processes share
the same database when you set the MemoryCache or MMapCache flag.

Memory usage is about the same as the database file size, no matter how
many child processes Apache spawns. The only thing to remember is ask
Apache to update if your database changes. Use the graceful restart
option to do so without stopping Apache.

Performance
-----------

For improved performance, you may want to enable mod_geoip only for
specific HTML pages. If you want to use the mod_geoip module site-wide,
you may still be able to only use it for HTML pages and not images. To
restrict the pages where mod_geoip2 is used, place the `GeoIPEnable On`
directive inside a , or directive, see:
[httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/sections.html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/sections.html)

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the module is not working, make sure that the httpd user (e.g.
nobody) has read access to the GeoIP database file(s) you are using.

If the GeoIP variables do not show up please make sure that the client
IP address is not on a private network such as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12
or 192.168.0.0/16. GeoIP can only look up public IP addresses.
